# Repository Agent Instructions

This repository contains documentation and (eventually) code for the **Buttox Catalog & WhatsApp Ordering** platform.
All contributors must follow these guidelines:

1. **Keep documentation in sync**: the project scope is defined in
   - `docs/escopo-tecnico.md` (Vytalle Est√©tica version 1.0)
   - `docs/escopo-buttox-v2.md` (Buttox version 2.0)
   Any feature or code should comply with these documents. Update them if requirements evolve.
2. **Testing**: if the repository contains automated tests, run them after changes. Include the results in your PR description.
3. **Program structure**: prefer a clear and minimal Next.js setup with Supabase integration as described in the scope documents. Ensure routes and configuration files are checked in.
4. **Documentation**: update the README and relevant docs whenever you add new features. Explain how to run, test and deploy the project.
5. **Pull requests**: summarize major changes and reference the scope documents when relevant. Include `git status` and test output in the PR body.
